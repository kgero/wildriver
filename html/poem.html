    var poem = "One bird, two. Another with its mouth open,~\
maybe at the grumble from my stomach. Another~\
with its mouth closed and head tilted,~\
eyeing me straight on. Seagull, and parakeet, ~\
and kookaburra, a menagerie of birds with~\
no allegiance to origin, though they are all~\
line drawings. Unreal, animated only by~\
the dove cooing somewhere outside.~\
My father snores softly from the bed,~\
exquisite in his very real flesh, which shudders~\
oh-so-slightly with all that moves within him.~\
A pigeon coos too, outside, ~\
occasionally competing with the dove, ~\
but mostly the air stays so still I can hear ~\
the ocean like static in my ears, ~\
the gentle ringing a memory of a place~\
I'm about to forget."
